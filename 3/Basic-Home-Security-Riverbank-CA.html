<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
