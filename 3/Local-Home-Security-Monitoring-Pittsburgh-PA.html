<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
