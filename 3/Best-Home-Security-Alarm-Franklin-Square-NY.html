The video is going to consume up storage area rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage when you reach the system's capability, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious attacker, given that the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and in fact indirectly protects information by preventing it from being transferred. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying a chance for the malicious assailant to tape these codes and use numerous breaking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key recorded during the network recovery.</p>

For instance, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage space for footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>
