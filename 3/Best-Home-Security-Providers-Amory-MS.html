Your system can serve as a center for as much as 119 smart home gadgets, and can be managed by means of Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TELEVISION, and more. IP cameras can also be linked to what is called a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends information from the camera and offers power to it.

<h3>Cheap Surveillance Cameras in Amory MS</h3>
<p>Firstly, it's hard to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly 2 years of night, usage and day images have actually always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we came across when checking the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion found.
