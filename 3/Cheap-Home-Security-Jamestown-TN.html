<p>SimpliSafe's mobile and web app controls are likewise very basic, and don't have almost the design or polish of a few of its competitors. They get the job done, but they will not win any awards for their eye candy.

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>

<p>Choose camera positioning: Decide where indoor cameras will sit. The easiest placement is on a tabletop or shelf. Remember, many indoor cameras must be plugged into a wall socket, which might limit where the camera sits.
