<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
