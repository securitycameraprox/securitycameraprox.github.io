By regulation, only incorrect alarms triggered by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquake or other catastrophic events, go through appeal.

<p>There need to be a clear line of sight between wireless transceivers, so that each camera can see" the home building to send video. We tried each of the cameras in multiple locations around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).

Tech is expected to make our lives easier and Hive's environment lives up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
