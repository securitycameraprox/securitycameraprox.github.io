<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader location and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
