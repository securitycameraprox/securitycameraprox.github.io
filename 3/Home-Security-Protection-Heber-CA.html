<p>All persons with alarm systems securing a property in the City of Fredericksburg must have a legitimate alarm permit. The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control becomes part of the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface uses extra information that might never have actually been possible before, such as notice of an employee, by name and recognition number, going into the building. An image of that staff member exists on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating occurs.</p>
<p>Maybe this is no better showed than through Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted just how much had changed since he handled the function in 2014, with the development of facial acknowledgment, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and much more. Modern systems now have remarkable capabilities", though these have actually developed reasonable misgivings about the danger for personal privacy and possible abuse such abilities develop. Porter therefore kept in mind that the Office and surveillance market must make sure only hardware and software certified with appropriate requirements, such as Secure by Default, is installed in public and personal spaces alike.</p>
