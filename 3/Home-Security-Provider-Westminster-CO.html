<p>ASIN: B01DJ1FTTS Foscam R2 2MP 1080P HD Wireless Security Camera (Black)I purchased the Foscam R2 2MP 1080P HD Wireless Security Camara - black about one week ago, my oriental function was to keep my child's sobbing noticed easily with this camera, and it works excellent till now. The package is functional and charming, the instructions are simple to follow and check out. The touch of the camera is soft and sophisticated, as displayed in the picture, it resembles matte black and seems rather state-of-the-art. There's a page with a QR code and it will lead you to app download, the welcome page of the app is quite appealing as shown in the image.</p>
<p>Some of those features make your home (and business) more secure, like clever door locks, a remote garage door controller, and a doorbell camera. Other functions mainly include convenience, like a clever thermostat or combinations with wise light bulbs and other smart home gadgets. So if you wish to use a mobile app to close your garage door from that midtown business lunch or you simply wish to adjust all the lights from your office chair, Vivint has you covered.</p>
