<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
