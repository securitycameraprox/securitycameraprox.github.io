<p>Firstly, it's tough to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the cost. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly two years of day, night and usage images have constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when testing the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We have actually seen it highlight mice, moths, and cars.</p>

<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is essential. If there are no as-built files supplying performance and configuration info to make this integration work, there are only two choices. The first choice, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is reluctant or not available to provide those details) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to rip and replace, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
