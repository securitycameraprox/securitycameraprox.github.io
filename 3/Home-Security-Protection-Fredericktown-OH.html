<p>We didn't consider alarm that required expert installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, usage equipment similar to that of DIY systems, featured usually burdensome and long contracts, and typically depend on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they provide little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated individually and don't advise for the majority of people.</p>

Unlike with analogue cameras, details such as number plates are easily legible. At 11 Mpix, forensic quality images are made where each hand on a person can be identified.
