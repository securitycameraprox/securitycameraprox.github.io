The older Nest Webcam, with the previous design, is still on sale if you require something a little cheaper. You still get 1080p HD streaming, and access to the really user-friendly app - just not as many of the additional bells and whistles. Some house owners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll discourage possible intruders. These signs may be attached to a front door, a popular window, posted in the front yard, or at the top of a driveway.
