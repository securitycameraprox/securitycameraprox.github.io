<p>In the evening, though it lacks the complete IR LED range of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not just is the Arlo fast to select moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's looking at. Simply a couple years back, the home security market was controlled by a couple of big names offering pricey, stiff strategies with little versatility and unfriendly, long-lasting agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors connected to a keypad control board and run through a landline. Nowadays, this has all changed.</p>
