<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible culprits are less most likely to devote criminal offense if they think they are being watched or have a greater threat of being apprehended. This is also known as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention method, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by modifying a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the crime, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the culprit needs to understand the added surveillance for it to accomplish its preferred result.</p>
