<p>TP-Link's Kasa Cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that might equal a few of our top picks. It also comes with two days of totally free cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can pack in clips of as much as 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

It's likewise more tamper-proof than any of our other picks, but that added security makes for a more difficult installation procedure, and it costs almost twice the cost of the Nest Camera Outdoor.</p>
<p>Outdoor security cameras are more than resilient for indoor usage. With certain security cameras, like large bullet cameras, are simply too large to be set up easily indoors.
