<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later created to address the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption plans, any customer in the network that knows the keys can read all the traffic.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which use several other benefits over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and allows for systems to be scaled up far more quickly than can be finished with DVR.
