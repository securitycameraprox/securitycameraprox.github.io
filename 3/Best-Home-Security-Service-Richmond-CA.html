With other companies, we believe mobile access deserves the extra cost so you can check in at any time and control your system from anywhere. Bullet cameras are long and round fit and are perfect for outdoor use. Their strengths lie specifically in applications which require long distance viewing. Installed within protective casings, the cameras are shielded versus dust, dirt and other natural aspects.

<p>Nurse calling systems typically include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom.

The majority of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and alerts, sensing units, access control, and so on.
