<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible culprits are less likely to dedicate crime if they think they are being viewed or have a higher threat of being apprehended. This is also referred to as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to offend can be reduced by modifying a range of systems such as increasing the risk of a culprit being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and reducing justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the transgressor needs to understand the added surveillance for it to achieve its preferred effect.</p>
