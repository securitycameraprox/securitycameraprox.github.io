The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and watch it later.

<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, but the compatibility concern extends well beyond that distinction. Some NVR systems, for instance, work with the IP cameras just from particular manufacturers and not others. When purchasing a video recorder, you need to first make sure that the gadget will deal with the cameras you've bought.
