<p>If an alarm goes off when you're away, this house Beginner Package will just let you know that there's an emergency situation. It will inform you if the motion sensors or entry sensors have been triggered. However, there's no other way for you to in fact see if there's a genuine issue for you to be worried about.

Remember that the more functions and bonus you add to your system, the bigger the cost. Some top-tier packages cost up of $60 each month. That's still considerable, but it's a lot less than the average loss of a break-in. While the rate of burglaries nationally has reduced, the average loss has increased-- in 2018, that number was close to $3,0002 (more on that in the break-in stats area above).</p>
