<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly.
