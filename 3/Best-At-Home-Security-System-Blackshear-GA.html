It's prolonged, and that's a good thing if your preferred installing location isn't close to an outlet. The Nest also features clips to make the installation clean and more difficult to swipe off the side of a house.</p>
<p>So, wired or wireless? In short, the kind of security system that you require will depend on what you're looking for.
