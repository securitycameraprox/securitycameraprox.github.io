<p>At night, though it does not have the full IR LED variety of some rivals, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're positioning it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not only is the Arlo quick to choose moving items, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's looking at. Simply a couple years ago, the home security market was dominated by a few huge names providing expensive, stiff plans with little versatility and hostile, long-lasting agreements.

A great deal of smart cameras can be set to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives simpler and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any frustration.</p>
