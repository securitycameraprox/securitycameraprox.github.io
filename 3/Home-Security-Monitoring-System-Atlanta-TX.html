<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
