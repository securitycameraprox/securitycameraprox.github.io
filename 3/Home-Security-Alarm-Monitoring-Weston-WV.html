The regulation needs monitored burglar alarms in unincorporated Douglas County, the city of Castle Pines and the town of Larkspur to be signed up and pay a yearly $40 permit cost. The alarm installation or monitoring company, not the home owner or business owner, is needed to register the alarm and pay the charge. Burglar alarms are planned to prevent burglary and to assist authorities nab intruders, which, if done dependably and efficiently, benefits the general public at large. If, nevertheless, alarm systems are inefficient or undependable, the drain on cops resources from responding to them might surpass their benefits.
