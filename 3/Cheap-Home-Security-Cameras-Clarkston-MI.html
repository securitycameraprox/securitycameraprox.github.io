As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
