<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
