<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out smart device informs with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
