<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated smart home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is expensive, extra sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you don't commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
