<p>Some wireless systems are susceptible to structural or electromagnetic interference. Radio frequencies go around strong objects; they can not go through them. So positioning sensing units in the right areas is essential if you want them to work correctly.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, because it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
