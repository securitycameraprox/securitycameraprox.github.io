<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is take advantage of any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if required, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
