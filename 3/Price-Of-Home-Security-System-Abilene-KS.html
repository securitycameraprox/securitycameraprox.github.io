<p>When a fire and smoke alarm in one of our home security systems is received, a qualified ADT specialist will notify you and your local fire department as rapidly as possible. Connect Interactive may have a lot of equipment, but it's not always the most attractive stuff out there. Plus, Link Interactive's not as widely known of a brand as, say, ADT.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

<p>Wireless security cameras being evaluated in a Customer Reports laboratory. If you do encounter a home intrusion emergency, you can activate the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm must be enough to scare away trespassers in many cases. Security cameras are a great start to securing your home.

<p>For those who are still stressed over their security system being hacked into, there are steps that can be required to reduce the risk. The very first of them is to secure the system. Set up firewall programs, check for firmware updates, use a strong password, frequently alter old passwords, and get devices that support two-factor authentication. Make sure to keep a check on your camera logs and avoid accessing your security system from a public WiFi network. Think about that wired systems are much less vulnerable to hacking if the risk of being hacked is still a substantial concern.</p>
