<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a number of companies offer "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first few months. Many insurer use discount rates on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments provide several "free" incorrect alarms prior to enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of permitting three or four complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, because they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
