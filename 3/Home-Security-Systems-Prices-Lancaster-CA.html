We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of up to 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer support experience varies extensively depending upon the dealership you opt for.
