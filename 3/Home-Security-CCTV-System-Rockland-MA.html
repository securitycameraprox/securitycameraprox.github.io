When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send smartphone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

<p>Lots of wireless home security systems are can be installed by the property owner and have an easy setup procedure.
