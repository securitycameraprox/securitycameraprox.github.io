<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and scams. Meet our preferred option for home monitoring and protection: the Piper nv Smart Home Security System with Night Vision and a 180-degree Video Camera. The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's left to the company's courteous, educated experts. Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was respectful, timely, and honest (even minimizing his expense after realizing they didn't need to install one camera).</p>
<p>When we state that wireless home security uses you alternatives, we suggest it. The equipment you pick makes your system what it is, so we have actually described some of your alternatives to help you decide what type of equipment you desire or require for your home system. To begin, it helps to write down what you require secured. For instance, in an apartment you may need one door sensor and one window sensing unit. In a big house, you might need two door sensing units, 8 window sensing units, a garage door sensor, cameras, motion detectors, and more. You will not pay extra for features and equipment that you won't utilize if you know what you require going in.</p>

Wyze's recently launched Total Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't recommend that for home security since if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
