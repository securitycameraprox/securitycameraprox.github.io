<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would signal users when it identified any kind of interference.

<p>Diy home security companies aren't like the ADTs and Vivints of the world.

Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and supply physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to require cops response.</p>
