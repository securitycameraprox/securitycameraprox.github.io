<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
