Lots of insurer offer discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of police departments offer a number of "complimentary" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, even though the cost to react is considerable right from the start.
