Like others on our list, the DVR system deals with a mobile app that lets you view what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our screening that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then required to be re-added.</p>
<p>There's no dedicated hub included here - each camera connects directly to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.
