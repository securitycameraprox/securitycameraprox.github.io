CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a great security camera and an extraordinary value.

The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage. However the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is found. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we tested, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription.
