Figure 1-1 depicts an example of a CCTV installation that monitors select locations of protection. The very first installation was created and developed for the different parking center.

The PCU is an easy device for handling the input and output of video feeds through the coax cable televisions. Secondary utilities and devices can supply easy combination of some alarms, but this innovation has restricted capabilities and a complex integration process.</p>
