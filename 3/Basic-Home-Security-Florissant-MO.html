<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
