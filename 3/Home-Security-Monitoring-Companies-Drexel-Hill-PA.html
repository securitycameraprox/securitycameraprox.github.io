Sometimes, anyone could open an internet browser window and view a camera's live video stream and witness the plate catches in real time.

(You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey general per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service.

We especially like this camera's wide, 180-degree field of vision, since you're less likely to get a blind spot wherever you set it up.
