<p>During the night, though it does not have the full IR LED range of some competitors, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight available if you're placing it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the great motion detection.

Just a couple decades earlier, the home security industry was dominated by a couple of big names using costly, rigid strategies with little versatility and hostile, long-lasting contracts.
