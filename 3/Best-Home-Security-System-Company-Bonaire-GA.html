<p>Before picking a security unit, understand how the system works. Numerous security units utilize WiFi, cellular signals, or ethernet cable televisions to communicate.

However, homeowners with weak internet should not go with a WiFi-driven system since the signal will continue to render the security and drop system worthless.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a concern.</p>
