This is also called the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention technique, which argues that opportunities to offend can be lowered by changing a variety of systems such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the wrongdoer needs to be aware of the included surveillance for it to attain its desired effect.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras are much better at catching crooks after they have devoted a criminal activity, rather than having the ability to stop a crime in progress.
