<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually via 110VAC power.</p>
