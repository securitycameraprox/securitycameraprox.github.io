<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. Arlo Pro 2 also has an outstanding Night Vision feature. It is geared up with infrared lenses that allow the camera to tape-record videos even in total darkness. It has about 25 feet of exposure during the night. As such, even if someone breaks into your home in total darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your smartphone app. The only issue here is that the taped footage will be black and white and a little dark so you may not have the ability to see information plainly.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
