<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to get sensors needed to control your equipment consisting of making it possible for, disabling and sending you immediate notifies.

<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, because it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
