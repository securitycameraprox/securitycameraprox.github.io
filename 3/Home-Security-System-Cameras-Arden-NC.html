The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
