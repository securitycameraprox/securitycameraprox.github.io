If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide.

<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. If your camera identifies motion or noise, you can activate a video clip or a SmartThings automation. This series of events also operates in reverse. For example, if somebody opens your front door when your SmartThings system is set to away," you can record a clip and sound your Arlo siren (which happens to be the loudest of the three sirens). Or, if Arlo Pro identifies a sound, you can have your lights set to switch on. Regrettably, the integration with SmartThings still has bugs and not everything works as it should; nevertheless, the capacity is still there.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are range problems.</p>
