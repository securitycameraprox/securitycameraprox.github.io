<h3>Home Security Monitoring System in Michigan</h3>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would alert users when it identified any type of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a best storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the issue. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as conclusive, we believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the present system.</p>

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents consulting with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a property owner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
