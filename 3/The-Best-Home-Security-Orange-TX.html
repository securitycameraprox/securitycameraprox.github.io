When it discovered any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe responded with a declaration stating the system would signal users. The company likewise questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be a perfect storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system.

<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug.
