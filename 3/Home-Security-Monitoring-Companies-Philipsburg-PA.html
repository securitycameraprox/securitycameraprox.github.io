<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR.
