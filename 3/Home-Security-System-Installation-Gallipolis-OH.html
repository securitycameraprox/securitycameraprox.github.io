<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the first few months. Lots of insurance companies use discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments offer numerous "complimentary" false alarms prior to imposing any fine, although the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or four totally free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
