<p>Dual paths allow distinction in between hardware failures and a real attack on the alarm. This assists eliminate unnecessary responses and false alarms.

<p>Everybody we dealt with at NSS were very valuable and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we wanted, and they performed with professionalism and proficiency.

Prior to 2004, the Seattle Authorities Department reacted to more than 25,000 alarm system calls each year. That many people weren't in risk-- 97% of the calls were simply false alarms.</p>

Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
