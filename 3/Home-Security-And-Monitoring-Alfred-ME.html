<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
