<h3>Wireless Home Security Companies in New York</h3>

Installing your own home security tech - wireless security cameras, IP cameras, motion detectors - is more straightforward than ever. You no longer need reams of cable television, a bank of screens, or a big hard disk drive to save all the video, due to the fact that everything can be set up in minutes and managed from your phone.</p>
<p>A wireless home security system uses a radio frequency to communicate with the control panel and sensors. The control panel then interacts with a monitoring center using a cellular signal. And, if you have a video camera, the video recordings are sent out to a receiver that's connected to your local or cloud storage. The Nest Webcam Outdoor uses a separate install, rather than an integrated one, so you're not limited to seeing one area. The mount is magnetic, but it's strong, so you can easily attach the camera and move it up, down, and everywhere in between.</p>
<p>With a kid on the way, you might want to include a camera to your nursery - no problem. When your kids become more mobile, you can add additional sensors to kitchen area cabinets or the freezer.

Vivint's monitoring costs remain in line with our other top security companies, which is remarkable provided the innovative proprietary equipment and services that feature a Vivint home security system. We also like that Vivint gives you the alternative to buy your equipment outright, which implies you're off the hook for a long-term contract-- however that does need a hefty up-front payment.</p>
<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
