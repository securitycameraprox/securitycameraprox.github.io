These are all relatively intelligent modes, but they can not be changed. You can't alter the sensitivity of the sensing units or arrange them. This also leaves you vulnerable to incorrect alarms, especially if you have small kids or family pets in your house. Some people prefer the lack of customizability because it makes the whole device very easy to use. But it can also be a significant obstacle for some.</p>
