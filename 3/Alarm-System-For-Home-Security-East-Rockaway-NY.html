<h3>Residential Alarm Companies East Rockaway NY 11518</h3>
<p>When it comes to home security systems, Houston citizens have options. You can select a nationally recognized brand name or opt for a local company. Both offer comparable offerings, but if you believe there's a chance you might leave the Houston area in the future, you might be much better off partnering with a national brand that you can take with you when you move. Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera combined with a 2,000-lumen light in an entirely wire-free component. (You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by combining the battery with outdoor cabling). It also has a number of the Arlo Pro 3's features, including 2K recording, two-way audio, and a built-in siren. Also like the camera, it requires an Arlo Smart membership to store video recordings.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
