The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost 2 years of usage, day and night images have constantly been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we encountered when testing the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.
