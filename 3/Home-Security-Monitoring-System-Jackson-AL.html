However, alarms needed by insurance companies need to comply with the European Requirement EN 50131 and should be set up by an NSI or SSAIB recognized installer.

<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't advise it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time may choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling visits and requiring time off from work. Calling in a technician costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert manage the job and do not mind investing the money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>

It's constantly an excellent concept to connect detectors to your system so that a monitoring center can alert you and emergency dispatch in case the alarm is set off.</p>
