<h2>Monitored Alarms Before Signing Up To That Expensive Monitoring Contract Tomball</h2>
<p>As the name recommends, this alarm system is a starter set". So it's pretty much expected that it won't have extended customizability or a wide range of functions.

When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.
