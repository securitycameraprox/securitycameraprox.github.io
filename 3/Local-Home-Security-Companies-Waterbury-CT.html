<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
