Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
