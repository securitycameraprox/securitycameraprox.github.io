<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
