<p>Clear night vision is one of the most crucial functions for outdoor security cameras.

The number of infrared LEDs utilized in a camera identifies how far your outdoor security camera will be able to plainly reveal what's outside your home.

Activate expert monitoring with a Ring Secure Plus subscription to get a lot more for a lot less. For just $10 a month or $100 a year, you can watch your savings grow with Ring.</p>
<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be an effective security alternative (although we liked it as a pet cam ).

We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with person detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>
