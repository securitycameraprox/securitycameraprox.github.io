Wireless Security Systems utilize local disk drive, cloud storage, or a combination of the two in location of videotape video made use of by landline systems. Thankfully, their systems are Do It Yourself; we had our cameras and sensors installed in about 25 minutes (not great, but not horrible).

But, they're the very best home security cameras if you're trying to find active monitoring.

We recommend cellular systems because they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't offered. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still better than no security at all.</p>
<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage alternative and others do not. For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped.

This option is generally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is generally a paid service and the number of hours it will keep will depend upon how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
