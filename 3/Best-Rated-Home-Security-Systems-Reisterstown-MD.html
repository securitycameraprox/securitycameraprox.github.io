<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and therefore provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I would not suggest it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time may choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling visits and taking some time off from work. Hiring a specialist costs more, however for those who choose to let an expert handle the task and do not mind investing the extra money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>
