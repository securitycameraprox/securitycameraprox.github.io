<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal construction.

Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
