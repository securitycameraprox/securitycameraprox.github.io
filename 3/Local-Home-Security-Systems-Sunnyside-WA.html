<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and absolutely like it. Excellent clearness. I wanted to establish seeing on my cell phone but had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. However, those features come at a comparatively high rate: $5 each month ($50 per year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 annually) for one month of video history.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
