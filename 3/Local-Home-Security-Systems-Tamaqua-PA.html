<p>Wide Dynamic Cameras have the ability to balance light-levels on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Certain camera models include highly beneficial features that accommodate particular security needs.

<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't advise it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and taking some time off from work. Employing a service technician costs more, however for those who prefer to let a professional deal with the job and don't mind investing the additional money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
