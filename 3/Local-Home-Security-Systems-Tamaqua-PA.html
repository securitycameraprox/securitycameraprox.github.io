<p>Wide Dynamic Cameras have the ability to balance light-levels on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Certain camera models include highly beneficial features that accommodate particular security needs. Abode is the only security provider we've seen that provides temporary professional monitoring. Based on our evaluation, however, there are numerous disadvantages to choosing Frontpoint Security.

<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't advise it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and taking some time off from work. Employing a service technician costs more, however for those who prefer to let a professional deal with the job and don't mind investing the additional money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
