<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
