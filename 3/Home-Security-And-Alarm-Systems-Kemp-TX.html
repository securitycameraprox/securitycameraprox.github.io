<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.
