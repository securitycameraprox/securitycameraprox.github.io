<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 organisations, universities, and government facilities, and residential clients. A basic system will usually just include the control board, sensors, and an audible alarm. If you want any other functions, you will either have to buy a more advanced bundle or add-on to your basic system, which, depending on the brand name, could get costly.
