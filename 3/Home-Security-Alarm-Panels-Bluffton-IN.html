<h3>Cheap Home Security Cameras in Indiana</h3>
<p>Frontpoint offers 5 packages and 2 monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester selected the Interactive strategy however wound up dissatisfied with its lack of live video surveillance. When she received an alarm notice while on vacation, she had no other way of evaluating whether her home had been burglarized or if her cat had actually managed to trip the sensor. It turned out to be an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting eight times over two months. Scout is extremely simple to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it allows you to manage almost every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly customizable.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't advise it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling appointments and taking some time off from work. Calling in a professional costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert deal with the job and do not mind spending the extra money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>

A membership likewise ensures that you'll be covered if you go away for a few days. The Circle Safe Basic strategy offers 14 days of video storage for $4 monthly per camera (compared with $5 for five days for Nest Aware). The $10 Premium strategy bumps that as much as 31 days of storage (compared to $10 for 10 days for Nest Aware) and includes motion zones, filter alternatives, and the ability to distinguish between individuals and other things.</p>
