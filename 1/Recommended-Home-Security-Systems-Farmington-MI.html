<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a great security camera and an extraordinary value. It receives an Excellent rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage. But the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is identified. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is even more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Sentinel, and it's our top recommendation if you do not want to pay for that system's costly (however perhaps rewarding) human monitoring service.

Wyze's just recently released Complete Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 per month per camera.

If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no spaces in between.
