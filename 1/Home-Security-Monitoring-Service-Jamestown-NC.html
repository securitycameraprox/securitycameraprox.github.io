<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly.

Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
