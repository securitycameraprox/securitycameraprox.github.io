<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm.
