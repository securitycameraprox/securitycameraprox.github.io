<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective culprits are less likely to commit crime if they think they are being watched or have a higher danger of being captured. This is also called the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to anger can be lowered by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the wrongdoer must know the included surveillance for it to achieve its preferred effect.</p>
