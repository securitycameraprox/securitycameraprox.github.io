<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
