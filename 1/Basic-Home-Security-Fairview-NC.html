<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
