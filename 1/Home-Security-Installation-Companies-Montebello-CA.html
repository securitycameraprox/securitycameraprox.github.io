Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since apparently they auto renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.
