These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to the web and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded video is stored in the cloud.</p>

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would notify users when it identified any kind of disturbance. The company likewise questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be a best storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system.
