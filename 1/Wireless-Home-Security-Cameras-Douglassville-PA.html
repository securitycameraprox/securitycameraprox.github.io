To hold and recover costs alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company need to be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical evidence like camera footage or a broken window to necessitate authorities response.</p>
