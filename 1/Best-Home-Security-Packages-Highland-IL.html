IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.

<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
