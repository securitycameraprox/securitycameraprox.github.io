<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
