<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
