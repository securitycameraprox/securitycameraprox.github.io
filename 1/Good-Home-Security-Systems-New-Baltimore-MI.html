<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we liked it as a family pet webcam ). It has actually considering that been improved and now equals our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home integration alternatives.

<p>Nurse calling systems generally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's washroom.
