<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
