<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective transgressors are less most likely to commit criminal activity if they believe they are being viewed or have a higher risk of being nabbed. This is also called the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to anger can be lowered by modifying a range of systems such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being nabbed, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal offense, decreasing benefits from crime commission, and lowering justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit needs to know the added surveillance for it to accomplish its preferred impact.</p>

Given that, its advantages - preventing at most a few street criminal offenses, and probably none - are disproportionately small.</p>
