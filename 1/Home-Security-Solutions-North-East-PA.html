Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 per month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't recommend that for home security because if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
