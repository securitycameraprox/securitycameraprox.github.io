<p>Camera, or closed-circuit tv (CCTV), are becoming an increasingly more extensive function of American life.

It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
