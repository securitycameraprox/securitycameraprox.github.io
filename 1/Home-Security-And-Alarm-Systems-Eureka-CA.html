<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

The install is magnetic, but it's strong, so you can quickly attach the camera and move it up, down, and all over in between.</p>
