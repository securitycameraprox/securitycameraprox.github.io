<p>It's frustrating that the Yi Outdoor Camera does not have individuals informs that are on the company's indoor camera, given that those might truly minimize notices of bugs and vehicle lights.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
