<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
