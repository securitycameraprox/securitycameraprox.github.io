<p>All persons with alarm systems securing a property in the City of Fredericksburg should have a valid alarm permit. The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control belongs to the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface provides additional information that might never have been possible previously, such as notice of an employee, by name and identification number, entering the structure.
