<p>Home: Best for smart homes-- Home gives you special equipment functions plus versatile expert monitoring. Quite the powerhouse combo. I put this wireless CCTV camera type top of the list simply because if you don't know it, you will lose big. Intelligent technology knows the distinction. With clever sensing units, you and your animal can stay secured without worry of false alarms. It is much better to have a separate computer system (server) for publishing video to the cloud. In this case, up until the burglar gets to the server, the video has actually already been sent out. However it is meaningless if you are using a wireless connection for cameras, as in this case it is rather easy to turn them off with a jammer.</p>

If you have big family pets, you may want to think about skipping the motion sensing units and rely more on the window and door sensors which aren't set off by motion however are triggered when a window or door is opened.</p>
<p>No. Self-monitoring does not indicate DIY installation. There are many companies that offer self-monitoring and expert installation. Keep in mind there will be a one-time installation cost. The cost will differ depending on the intricacy of the system. There are also companies that use assistance hotlines for people trying to install a system by themselves, so if a question turns up a homeowner can get answers without gazing at a manual for hours.</p>
