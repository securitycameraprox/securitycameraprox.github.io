Furthermore they can not transfer fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution bits of video.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
