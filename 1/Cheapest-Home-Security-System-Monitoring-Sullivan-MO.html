<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling appointments and taking time off from work. Hiring a professional costs more, but for those who prefer to let a professional deal with the task and don't mind spending the additional money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is bad. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>

<p>Wireless security cameras being evaluated in a Customer Reports laboratory. You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home invasion emergency. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm should be enough to scare away burglars in many cases. Security cameras are an excellent start to securing your home.
