<p>The genuine factor cameras are usually deployed is to minimize much pettier crimes. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the problem have actually found that they have actually not minimized criminal offense. "As soon as the criminal activity and offence figures were adjusted to appraise the general down trend in criminal offenses and offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in particular classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had lowered criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
