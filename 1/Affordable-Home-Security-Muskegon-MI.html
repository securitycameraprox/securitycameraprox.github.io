<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to get sensing units required to manage your equipment including allowing, disabling and sending you immediate signals.

<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and once again in consumer reviews, and it delivers a crisp picture up to 32 feet. And although the app and software application are simple to work with, it's a little bit of a disappointment that you can't incorporate this camera with any clever home hubs or gadgets. A lot of wise cameras can be set to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's ecosystem lives up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
