If you're using a home automation center to manage things like lighting and thermostats, you can add a Z-Wave or Zigbee smart lock to the system without much effort. Alternately, if you do not have a home automation hub, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that includes its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize basic pre-drilled holes and are fairly simple to install. Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others need that you eliminate your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
