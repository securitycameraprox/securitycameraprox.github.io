A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that can detecting small differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and produces an electronic image based on info about the temperature level differences. Because items are hardly ever exactly the exact same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will look like distinct in a thermal image.</p>
