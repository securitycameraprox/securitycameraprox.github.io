<p>so say you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I suggest to have actually cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.

<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>
