Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge.
