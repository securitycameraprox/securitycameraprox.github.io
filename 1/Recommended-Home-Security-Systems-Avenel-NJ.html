Battery-powered Wi-Fi cameras are the most convenient to install since you can put them just about anywhere (as long as they can link to your router) without needing to snake a power cable into your home to plug into an outlet. These types of cameras typically utilize rechargeable batteries that can be quickly popped out and taken indoors for charging with a USB cable television, but they tend to drain pipes quickly in cooler weather.
