Despite the fact that it doesn't have the widest operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug.

When selecting which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system, the most significant factor to consider. The next factor to consider is how likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
