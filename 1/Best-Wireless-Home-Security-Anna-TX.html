<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions.

<p>The XT2's case is weatherproof, so you can stick it either inside your home or outside, and features a practical mounting bracket. While not tops, the 1080p video is records benefits the cost, and most importantly, it features free cloud storage (as much as two hours in total). Because Blink (and Ring) are owned by Amazon, the Blink app also has a connection to Ring's Neighbors app, where you can see a feed of other events in your community, and post videos from your Blink camera.

<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in client reviews, and it provides a crisp image as much as 32 feet. And although the app and software are simple to deal with, it's a little a letdown that you can't incorporate this camera with any clever home hubs or gadgets. A great deal of wise cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as basic as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives simpler and Hive's environment measures up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
