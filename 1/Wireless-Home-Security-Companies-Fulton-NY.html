Commercial cameras, however, frequently are equipped with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness instantly to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear correctly exposed and completely detail. If a camera can not record and deliver a sharp and properly-exposed image throughout the day and during the night, it has limited usefulness.</p>
