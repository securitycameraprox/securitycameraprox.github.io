<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
