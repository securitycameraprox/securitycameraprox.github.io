<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
