<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
