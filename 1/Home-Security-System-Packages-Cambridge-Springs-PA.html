<h3>Home Security Monitoring System in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>Following behind the Ultra 4K is the brand name new Arlo Pro 3, which delivers a comparable package however with 2K video instead.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
