Since objects are seldom specifically the same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>

Additionally, the general viewpoint is that the company's customer support is not really valuable when it pertains to repeating and repairing problems use problems.
