After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
