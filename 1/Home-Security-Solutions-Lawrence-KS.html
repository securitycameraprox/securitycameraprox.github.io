<p>The Wyze Webcam can also record video to the cloud, but the complimentary account is restricted to 12-second clips every 5 minutes.

Wyze's recently introduced Complete Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not recommend that for home security because if it's stolen, you do not have a backup.</p>
