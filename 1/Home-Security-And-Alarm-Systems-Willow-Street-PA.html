<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
