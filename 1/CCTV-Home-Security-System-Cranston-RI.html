<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically more secure, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel virtually vulnerable. The videos your camera records probably will not be saved on the camera itself. A lot of home security cameras utilize cloud services to save and provide remote access to footage Some designs have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you want to review footage, however this is an unusual function. Still, if innovation has made us vulnerable, then it can also make us secure. Tech companies have actually been pressing difficult to innovate in the connected home CCTV camera area. Big financial investments by the likes of Google-owned Nest, Amazon's Blink, and up-and-coming security company Ring have actually made home security cameras more prominent.</p>

That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to tape-record again, which indicates you may be missing out on a lot. Wyze's recently released Total Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, with no spaces in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not advise that for home security because if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
