<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out mobile phone informs with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

The Nest Webcam Outdoor utilizes a different mount, rather than an incorporated one, so you're not limited to seeing one area. The mount is magnetic, but it's strong, so you can easily connect the camera and move it up, down, and all over in between.</p>

Both provide comparable offerings, but if you think there's a possibility you might leave the Houston location in the future, you may be much better off partnering with a national brand that you can take with you when you move. Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera combined with a 2,000-lumen light in a totally wire-free component. (You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by combining the battery with outdoor cabling). It also has a number of the Arlo Pro 3's features, including 2K recording, two-way audio, and an integrated siren. Likewise like the camera, it needs an Arlo Smart membership to shop video recordings.</p>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra does not featured a complimentary tier of cloud storage, so you need to invest at least $3 per month if you wish to save any videos. And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.
