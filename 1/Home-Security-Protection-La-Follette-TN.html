The 2nd essential thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly raucous built-in alarm, so it operates as a home alarm system along with a security camera.

Limit access to your property with hedges, fencing, and tough shrubs. Likewise, it's simple to overshare on social networks, but it's smart not to transmit any upcoming journeys or family trips so bad people can learn when you're gone.
