Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
