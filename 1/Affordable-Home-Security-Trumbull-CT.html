<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation.

Sadly I purchased 4 cameras that look just like these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is truly terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
