<p>A lot of home security cameras perform the exact same basic functions-- they identify an event, record the event, and send you an alert-- but they do not all perform them the same method. And some cameras have special features that surpass those basics.

If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
