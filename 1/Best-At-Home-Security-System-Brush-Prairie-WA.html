<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Excellent clarity. I wished to set up viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for example. However, those features come at a relatively steep rate: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for 1 month of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the preliminary cost.

<p>Power-over-Ethernet changes use only to NVR systems, however they eliminated other elements that would be essential for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cable televisions used to connect cameras to the DVR.

<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in client reviews, and it delivers a crisp picture as much as 32 feet.
