<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
<p>The Ring Alarm Home Security System includes easy setup of the entire system without the need for tools or professional installation. It also depends upon how secure you want your house to be.
