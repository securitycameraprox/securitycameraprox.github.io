This suggests they usually over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing objects and individuals to appear blown out" and with no detail. So much for trying to recognize the bad guys. Commercial cameras, however, often are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear correctly exposed and in full detail.
