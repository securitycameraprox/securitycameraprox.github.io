<p>Mix of Male and Device: Individuals must be out on the work-places and streets attempting to avoid crime or losses. CCTV cameras are just a less efficient alternative to having police walk the streets or security personnel on patrolling and physical surveillance. Just like any innovation, using cameras is by no means an alternative to good old-fashioned ground work. The camera video footage offers additional leads in an investigation and help in protecting witness cooperation. The video footage works as a complement to - but not a replacement for - eyewitness proof in the courtroom.</p>
