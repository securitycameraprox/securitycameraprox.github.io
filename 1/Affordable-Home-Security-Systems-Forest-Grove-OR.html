<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
