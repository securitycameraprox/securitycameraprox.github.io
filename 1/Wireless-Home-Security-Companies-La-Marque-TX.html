<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using convenience, comfort and complete satisfaction to every client and are dedicated to satisfying our customer's requirements with integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm and excellent service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning numerous decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
<p>The only way to keep communication really secure is to use end-to-end file encryption For instance, when accessing an internet bank, one would usually use strong file encryption from the web browser and all the method to the bank - thus it should not be risky to do banking over an unencrypted wireless network. The argument is that anyone can sniff the traffic applies to wired networks too, where system administrators and possible hackers have access to the links and can check out the traffic. Likewise, anybody knowing the keys for an encrypted wireless network can gain access to the information being moved over the network.</p>

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Sound for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost. Due to the fact that it comes with several door and window sensing units for full protection, we advise the eight-piece package. We also suggest adding a doorbell video camera at some point. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Factor in the upfront cost of the control panel, activation fees, monitoring fees and all equipment.

<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that enables more light to go into the camera's sensor. The more light that is permitted to enter the camera the brighter the image will be. However, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image appearance fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital noise decrease Some security cameras now include infrared light that is invisible to the human eye but can be picked up by a security camera's sensing unit.</p>
