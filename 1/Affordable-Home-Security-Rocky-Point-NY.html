In general, however, everything did what it was expected to do. View our ratings and reviews, and search our buying guide to find the very best security camera for your home.</p>
<p>All of the self-installed systems I evaluated can operate without a monitoring strategy, but then they are limited to just sounding an alarm inside your home and in some cases, pressing a notice to your phone and do not have the ability to instantly dispatch authorities or emergency situation personnel.

<p>Wired: Each camera is connected to a recording unit, which in turn is connected to a router.

Wired systems are a much better alternative since they can support more cameras if you have a large home or property that needs thorough coverage.</p>
