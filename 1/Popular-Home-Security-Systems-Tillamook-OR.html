Some alarm systems serve a single function of burglary protection; combination systems offer both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm may also be integrated with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to instantly tape the activities of trespassers, and may interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors.

In Home mode, a loud 93dB alarm is activated whenever the entry sensors are triggered. Finally, in Away mode, both the motion sensing units and entry sensors are active. These are all relatively intelligent modes, but they can not be altered. You can't change the sensitivity of the sensors or arrange them.
