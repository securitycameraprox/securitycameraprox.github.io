Some alarm systems serve a single function of burglary protection; combination systems offer both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm may also be integrated with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to instantly tape the activities of trespassers, and may interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors.
