<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped case that the camera beings in. Whilst these are relatively discreet CCTV cameras in look, this doesn't stop them from discouraging crooks. Because the dome casing makes it really hard for individuals to see which direction the camera is pointing, this is. This creates an air of unpredictability for possible thieves or vandals approaching from all directions. If those scenarios seem like your life, Vivint and Link Interactive offer some flexibility on monitoring contract length if you buy equipment in advance.  Of our top five, SimpliSafe is the most flexible for the contract-averse. Some brand names, like Frontpoint, even let you move your equipment to a new home totally free.</p>

<p>Pick camera positioning: Choose where indoor cameras will sit. The simplest placement is on a tabletop or shelf.

Before choosing an area, inspect the camera's feed through the app to see the camera's field of vision. Change the camera so the most significant location is seen.
