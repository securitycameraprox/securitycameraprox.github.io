(Ord. 2002-28 § 1, 2002). The downside to monitored systems is the cost. You pay for the benefit of having another person keep an eye on your home security and, while numerous monitoring strategies are affordable, even a modest fee is more than unmonitored systems that charge no monthly charge.</p>

A wireless system can be relocated to a new home easily, an advantage for those who lease or who move frequently. The more important wireless connection for security is the one in between the control panel and the monitoring station.
