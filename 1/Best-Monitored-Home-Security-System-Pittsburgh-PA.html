Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning several years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually progressed into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
