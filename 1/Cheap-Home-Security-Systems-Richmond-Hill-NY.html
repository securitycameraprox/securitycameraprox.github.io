<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.

This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
