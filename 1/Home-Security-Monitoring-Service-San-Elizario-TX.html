Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
