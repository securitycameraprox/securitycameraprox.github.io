<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms happen.
