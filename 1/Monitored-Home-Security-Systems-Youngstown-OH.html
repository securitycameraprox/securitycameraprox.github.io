<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
