<p>At night, though it lacks the full IR LED range of some competitors, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're putting it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the fantastic motion detection.

Just a couple decades back, the home security market was controlled by a couple of huge names offering pricey, stiff strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-lasting agreements.

That likewise conserves battery life, but it may leave you with taping spaces during essential security occasions. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd advise one of our top choices, however the Arlo is fantastic for checking in on household and pets-- or stray felines slinking around your backyard.</p>
