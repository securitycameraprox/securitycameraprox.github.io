<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.
