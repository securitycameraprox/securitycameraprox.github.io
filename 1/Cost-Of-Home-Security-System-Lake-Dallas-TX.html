<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
