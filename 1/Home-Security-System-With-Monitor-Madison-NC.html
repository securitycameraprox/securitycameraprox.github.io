<p>All persons with alarm systems protecting a facility in the City of Fredericksburg must have a valid alarm license. The combination of digital video surveillance and access control belongs to the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single interface uses extra info that may never have actually been possible before, such as notification of an employee, by name and identification number, entering the structure.

These are all relatively intelligent modes, but they can not be altered. You can't alter the sensitivity of the sensing units or schedule them. This also leaves you susceptible to incorrect alarms, especially if you have small kids or animals in your home. Some individuals prefer the absence of customizability due to the fact that it makes the entire device exceptionally basic to use. However it can also be a major barrier for some.</p>

Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by an area cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen.

Prior to 2004, the Seattle Police Department reacted to more than 25,000 burglar alarm calls each year. That many individuals weren't in danger-- 97% of the calls were just incorrect alarms.</p>
