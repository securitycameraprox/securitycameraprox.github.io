Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if required, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
