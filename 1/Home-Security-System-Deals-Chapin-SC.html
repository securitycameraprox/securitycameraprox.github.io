<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
