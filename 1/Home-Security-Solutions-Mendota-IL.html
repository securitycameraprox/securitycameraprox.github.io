<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires.
