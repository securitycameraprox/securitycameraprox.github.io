<p>Houston home alarm companies that offer free" alarm systems are just hiding the equipment cost in your 3-5-year agreement. That equipment is paid for within the first year, however do they decrease your rate once it's paid off? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 regular monthly rate for a minimum of another 2+ years. That forces you to significantly overpay. Besides overpaying, what if their service is poor? Regrettable, you're caught in their contract.</p>
<p>We believe customer support is our very first concern, and we will constantly offer you the white glove treatment.
