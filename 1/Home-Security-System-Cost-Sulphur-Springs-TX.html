<p>Arlo declares that you should be able to get four to six months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level.

If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.

Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if needed, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
