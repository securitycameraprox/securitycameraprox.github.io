<p>Like any intrusive innovation, the advantages of releasing public video cameras should be balanced against the threats and costs. This technology (a) has the possible modification the core experience of heading out in public in America since of its chilling effect on people, (b) brings extremely genuine threats of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not significantly secure us versus terrorism.
