<p>We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
