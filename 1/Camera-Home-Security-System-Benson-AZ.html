<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey general per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it given that its battery-saving routines can disrupt performance.</p>
