<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
