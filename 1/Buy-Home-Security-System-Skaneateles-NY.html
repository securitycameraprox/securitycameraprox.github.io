These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments use a number of "free" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, even though the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers bring into question the appropriateness of the existing trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or 4 free incorrect alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front rewards to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
