<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

Still, you're ideal about the Arlo Pro not doing anything to keep rain from hitting the lens cover.</p>
<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, typically use battery-powered transmitters which are simpler to install and have less expensive start-up costs, however may fail if the batteries are not kept. Depending upon distance and construction materials, one or more wireless repeaters may be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably.

We tried each of the cameras in several areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
