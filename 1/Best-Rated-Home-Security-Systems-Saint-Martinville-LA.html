<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
