This implies they generally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing items and individuals to appear burnt out" and with no detail. So much for attempting to determine the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness instantly to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear properly exposed and completely detail.
