<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in client reviews, and it provides a crisp image as much as 32 feet.

A great deal of smart cameras can be set to do things like this, however few make things as basic as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function with no frustration.</p>
