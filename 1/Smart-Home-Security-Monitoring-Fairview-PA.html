<h2>Home Monitoring & Automation Fairview</h2>
<p>Many home security cameras perform the very same basic functions-- they find an event, record the event, and send you an alert-- however they don't all perform them the same way.

Nevertheless, after practically 2 years of day, night and use images have constantly been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We've seen it highlight automobiles, moths, and mice.</p>
