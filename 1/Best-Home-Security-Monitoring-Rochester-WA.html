<h2>Garmin GC 100 Wireless Camera Rochester</h2>
<p>In a current New york city Times article about Chicago's 911 expanding digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law teacher at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not violate any personal privacy concerns due to the fact that they are installed in public areas. They have actually been implemented for public safety and criminal activity prevention and are not for the exploitation of individuals. A private with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, may have a more self-satisfying program and thanks to digital technology and the Web can breach personal privacy laws with far more disastrous consequences than video surveillance cameras, which are kept protected and in stringent confidence.</p>
<p>Now let's analyze why consumer-grade cameras are typically poor night vision performers. When a camera attempts to see in the dark, it needs a light source to light up the location below it. Regrettably, the night vision illuminators that come with customer cameras are developed for short variety only and are of a fixed brightness. This means they typically over-expose what is nearby in a scene, causing items and individuals to appear blown out" and without any information. A lot for trying to recognize the bad guys. Commercial cameras, however, often are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness instantly to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear correctly exposed and completely detail. If a camera can not capture and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and in the evening, it has limited usefulness.</p>
<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
