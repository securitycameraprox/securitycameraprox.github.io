<p>All About Security supplies professional, reputable alarm monitoring services for homes and services throughout the greater Indianapolis location. Figure 1-1 portrays an example of a CCTV installation that keeps track of choose locations of protection. The very first installation was developed and developed for the different parking center. This application included numerous fixed position cameras on each floor of the parking garage, stairwells, and exits, all connected straight to a primary control system (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is a basic gadget for managing the input and output of video feeds through the coax cables. Supplementary utilities and gadgets can provide basic combination of some alarms, but this innovation has limited capabilities and a complex integration process.</p>
