<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
