<p>All persons with alarm systems securing a property in the City of Fredericksburg must have a legitimate alarm permit. The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control becomes part of the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single interface provides additional information that may never have actually been possible before, such as alert of a staff member, by name and recognition number, entering the building.

<p>Although it has a lot of versatility in placement, the Nest Webcam Outdoor does need a source of power, so it must be positioned within reach of an outlet.

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally through 110VAC power.</p>
