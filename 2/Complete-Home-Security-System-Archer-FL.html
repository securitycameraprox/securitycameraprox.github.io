Amongst IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the internet.

<p>Over 97% of home security alarms in Seattle end up being incorrect. That's why the Seattle Police Department (SPD) presented its False Alarm Program in 2004.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
