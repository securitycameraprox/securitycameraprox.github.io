<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, must provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to effectively find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it may leave you with taping gaps throughout important security events. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd recommend among our top choices, however the Arlo is excellent for checking in on household and pets-- or roaming felines slinking around your yard.</p>
