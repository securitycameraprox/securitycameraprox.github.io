Since that limits the number of entryways you can protect, we believe Home works best for smaller sized areas like an apartment or dorm. It's possible to include motion sensing units for about $30 each, but that can rapidly add up if you need to buy more than one or two. Just get the additionals you need. Be absolutely sure you can manage it if you're going to buy something on top of a company's basic home security packages.
