<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
