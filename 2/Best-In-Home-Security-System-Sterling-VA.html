<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to disregard things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
