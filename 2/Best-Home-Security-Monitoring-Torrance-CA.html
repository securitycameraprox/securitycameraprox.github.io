<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

<p>We considered just cameras that run over Wi-Fi without the need for a networked video recorder; we narrowed that note down based upon reviews, features, and price. Ring Alarm is one of the attractive security systems on the market. The style is a reflection of simplicity, and the design is sophisticated and clean. The Ring items are resilient and lightweight, and the keypad digits have a more vintage feel when you press them.

<p>Motion sensing units use backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. However they just run when you're out of the house. When you're sleeping, do not think they'll safeguard you if somebody gets in! Rather the opposite, your alarm in fact disregards motion sensor signals if you arm the system but stay at home. If the system worked any other way, it would false alarm each time you walked into a secured room.</p>
<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It requires an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is good. The motion sensing units work well. I would not recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and taking some time off from work. Employing a technician costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert manage the job and don't mind spending the money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
