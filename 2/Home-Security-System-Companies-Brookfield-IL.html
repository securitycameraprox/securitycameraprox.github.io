<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensors work well.

Employing a specialist costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert handle the job and do not mind spending the extra money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>
