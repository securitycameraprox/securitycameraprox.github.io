Regrettably, the night vision illuminators that come with consumer cameras are designed for brief variety only and are of a fixed brightness. This suggests they usually over-expose what is nearby in a scene, triggering objects and people to appear blown out" and with no detail. So much for trying to determine the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, typically are equipped with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene.
