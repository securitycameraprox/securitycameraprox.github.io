<p>Vivant's equipment for home automation puts them firmly on our list of best wireless home security systems. Most security companies provide options to automate your home.

<p>All of the self-installed systems I tested can operate without a monitoring strategy, but then they are limited to simply sounding an alarm inside your home and in many cases, pushing a notice to your phone and lack the capability to automatically dispatch authorities or emergency situation workers. Because phone batteries die and cellular service varies depending upon where you are, a push notice is generally a bad approach of triaging when your home security system has been tripped.</p>

<p>Wireless security cameras being evaluated in a Consumer Reports lab. If you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am slightly disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB.

<p>Pricing - Vivint isn't one of the lowest cost alternatives. A total choice of equipment will cost around $2,000, and there's no money-back warranty after 3 days. You can spread out the cost of the upfront financial investment over a picked period of time, but if you do so, you'll need to sign-up to a service strategy instead of pay-as-you-go (a 100% early cancellation cost would apply to that agreement).
