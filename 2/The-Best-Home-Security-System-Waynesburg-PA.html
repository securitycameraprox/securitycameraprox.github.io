<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
