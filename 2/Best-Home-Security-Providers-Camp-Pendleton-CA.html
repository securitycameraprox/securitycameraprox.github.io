<p>Arlo claims that you should have the ability to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
