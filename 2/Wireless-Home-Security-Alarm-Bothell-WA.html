<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we tested, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And in spite of having an appealing rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
