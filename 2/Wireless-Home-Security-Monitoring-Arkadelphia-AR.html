<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
