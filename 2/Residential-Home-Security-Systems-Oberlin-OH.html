<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more costly general per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
<p>Motion detectors are typically stationed at entry walls and in large rooms, and they are simple to set up.

Motion sensors work when you are far from home or when you trigger them. Follow all directions when positioning motion detectors for the most efficient and smooth security.</p>
