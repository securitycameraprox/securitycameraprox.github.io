Your system can function as a hub for as much as 119 clever home gadgets, and can be controlled through Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more. IP cameras can also be linked to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it.
