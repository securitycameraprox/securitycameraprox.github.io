<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
