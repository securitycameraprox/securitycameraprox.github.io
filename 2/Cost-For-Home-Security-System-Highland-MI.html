<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for keeping an eye on your animals and kids, but if you're worried about security, you do not wish to risk missing a second of the action.

Even though it does not have the best operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to innovative smart home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, consisting of smart things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.
