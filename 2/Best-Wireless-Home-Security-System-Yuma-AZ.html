<p>Arlo declares that you must be able to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term screening of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it's tough to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the road. Not terrific, not horrible, however with an actually simple setup procedure (and trust me, that truly is a killer function when it pertains to smart cameras.) This newer version is much the same, to be frank. With a digital video recorder DVR, you get clear audio and video and remote viewing, plus you can tape from all cameras at the same time.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and taking time off from work. Hiring a professional costs more, however for those who prefer to let an expert handle the task and don't mind spending the extra money, expert installation is the method to go.</p>
