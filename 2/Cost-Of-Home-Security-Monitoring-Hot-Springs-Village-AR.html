<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by.

However today you'll find more home security alternatives than ever prior to that deal shorter agreements and month-to-month (contract-free) terms-- particularly if you can spend for equipment in advance.
