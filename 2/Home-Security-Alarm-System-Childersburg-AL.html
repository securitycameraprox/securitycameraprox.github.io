<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
