<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Simply put, wireless security systems rely on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to receive sensors needed to control your equipment consisting of making it possible for, disabling and sending you instant signals. When a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, web, text, or email website. If your wireless home security system is professionally monitored, they'll also receive an alert to right away assist you with emergency responders as required.</p>
