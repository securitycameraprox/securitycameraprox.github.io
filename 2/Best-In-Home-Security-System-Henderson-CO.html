<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that.
