<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years!
