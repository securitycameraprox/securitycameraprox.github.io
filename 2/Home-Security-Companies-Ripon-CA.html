<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal building.

This produces an air of uncertainty for potential burglars or vandals approaching from all instructions.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
