<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
