<p>GO2 offers full-service Video Surveillance Installation of high definition (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Buying burglar security systems and devices from eBay really makes alarm companies flee from a sale. Many alarm companies would rather provide and install their own equipment instead of go through this inconvenience. For the most detailed protection of your residential or commercial property, you want something that includes night vision and can record at a decent quality - and almost all cameras now include at least HD (1080p) resolution.

<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And in spite of having an appealing cost and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
