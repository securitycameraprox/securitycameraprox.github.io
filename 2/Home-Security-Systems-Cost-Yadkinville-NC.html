<p>All individuals with alarm systems safeguarding a property in the City of Fredericksburg must have a valid alarm permit. The integration of digital video surveillance and access control belongs to the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface provides additional information that may never have actually been possible in the past, such as notice of a staff member, by name and identification number, getting in the structure. An image of that employee exists on screen for verification (verifying it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating takes place.</p>
<p>If a staff member (trusted entity) brings in a wireless router and plugs it into an unsecured switchport, the whole network can be exposed to anybody within range of the signals. Likewise, if a worker includes a wireless interface to a networked computer utilizing an open USB port, they may develop a breach in network security that would allow access to private materials. However, there work countermeasures (like disabling open switchports throughout switch configuration and VLAN setup to limit network gain access to) that are readily available to protect both the network and the details it includes, but such countermeasures must be used evenly to all network gadgets.</p>

<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.
