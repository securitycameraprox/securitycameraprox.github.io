<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be convenient for installation.

Regrettably I acquired 4 cameras that look just like these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is truly fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
<p>Although 1080p is usually the standard resolution for cameras we have actually evaluated, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensors.
