<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal construction.

Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that.
