When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if needed, could just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
