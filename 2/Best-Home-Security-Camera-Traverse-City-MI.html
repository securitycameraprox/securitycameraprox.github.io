<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious attacker, given that the interruption of the network prevents the circulation of information and actually indirectly protects information by preventing it from being transferred. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the harmful aggressor to tape-record these codes and use numerous breaking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key captured throughout the network recovery.</p>
