<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to use also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are variety issues.</p>
