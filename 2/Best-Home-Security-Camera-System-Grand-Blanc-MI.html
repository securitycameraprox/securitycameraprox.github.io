Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, come with usually burdensome and long contracts, and often count on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they use little benefit. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed independently and don't suggest for most people.</p>
<p>GO2 uses a variety of outdoor security cameras that are completely developed to supply reliable surveillance protection for your business or residence. Vivint's smart security equipment caters well to Seattle's dog-lovers, short-term rental owners, and techies.
