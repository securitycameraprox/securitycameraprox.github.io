<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
