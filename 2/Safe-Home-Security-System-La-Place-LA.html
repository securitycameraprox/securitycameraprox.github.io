<h2>CCTV Camera Systems, Security Cameras And CCTV Surveillance La Place</h2>
<p>Houston home alarm companies that use free" alarm systems are simply concealing the equipment cost in your 3-5-year contract. That equipment is paid for within the very first year, but do they reduce your rate once it's paid off? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 month-to-month rate for at least another 2+ years. That forces you to considerably overpay. Besides paying too much, what if their service is poor? Too bad, you're trapped in their contract.</p>
