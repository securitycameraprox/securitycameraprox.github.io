<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Fantastic clarity. I wanted to establish seeing on my cellular phone however had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what provides the video history and smarter signals, for example.
