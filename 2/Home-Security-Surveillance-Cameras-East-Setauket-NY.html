<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the required systems is essential. If there are no as-built files offering performance and setup details to make this integration work, there are just two options. The first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is reluctant or unavailable to offer those details) and document the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
