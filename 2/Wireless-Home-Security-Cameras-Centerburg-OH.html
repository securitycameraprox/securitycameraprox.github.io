<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and for that reason uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, normally through 110VAC power.</p>
