As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
