<p>The majority of security cameras just send you a notice when they discover any type of activity. Others can identify who-- or what-- is triggering the commotion.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It requires an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is good. The motion sensing units work well.

Employing a service technician costs more, however for those who choose to let a professional deal with the job and don't mind spending the extra money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>
