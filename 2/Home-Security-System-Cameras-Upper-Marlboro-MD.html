<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing convenience, assurance and satisfaction to every client and are devoted to fulfilling our consumer's requirements with stability, honesty, interest and outstanding service. Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A typical misconception is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to the internet and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the most convenient choice to install and all of the taped footage is stored in the cloud.</p>

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
