<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
