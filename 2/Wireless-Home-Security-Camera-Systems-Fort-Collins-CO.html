<p>You could invest a comparable quantity for the best home security system, but they don't monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. But, they're the very best home security cameras if you're looking for active monitoring.

We suggest cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>

CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having authorities stroll the streets or security workers on patrolling and physical surveillance. As with any technology, making use of cameras is by no means a replacement for good old-fashioned ground work. The camera video provides additional leads in an examination and help in securing witness cooperation. The video footage serves as a complement to - however not a replacement for - eyewitness proof in the courtroom.</p>
