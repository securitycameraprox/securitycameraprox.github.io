Well, it's a prepackaged security set that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring charges.

<p>Last time I examined a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the road.

<p>All of the self-installed systems I evaluated can operate without a monitoring plan, but then they are limited to simply sounding an alarm inside your home and sometimes, pressing a notice to your phone and lack the capability to automatically dispatch authorities or emergency workers.

<p>We downloaded each camera's app to an iPhone 7, an iPad, and a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie, when possible. The cameras spent weeks guarding our front door, signaling us to buddies, relative, shipment people, and even the milkman.
