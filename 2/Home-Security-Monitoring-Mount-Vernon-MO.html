<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be an effective security choice (although we loved it as a pet camera ). It has since been enhanced and now equals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home combination options. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of view, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
