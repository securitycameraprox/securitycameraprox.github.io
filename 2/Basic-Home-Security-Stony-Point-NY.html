<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
