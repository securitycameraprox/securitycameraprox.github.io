<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a variety of companies offer "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first couple of months. Many insurance companies provide discount rates on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments provide several "complimentary" false alarms before enforcing any fine, even though the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
