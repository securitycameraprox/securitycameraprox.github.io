<p>That prospective flaw aside, the Arlo Q provided sharp and vibrant 130-degree video and still images, in both intense and dim light, even when using the 8 x digital zoom. The night mode produced incredibly crisp images, however they didn't look as intense as the Logitech Circle 2's. Nevertheless, utilizing the SimpliSafe mobile app requires a paid monitoring plan.

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send mobile phone alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV).
