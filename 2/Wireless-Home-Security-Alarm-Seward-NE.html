Guidelines are required to develop a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and for how long are they maintained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be validated and enforced; and what punishments would apply to violators.</p>
