Sadly, the night vision illuminators that include customer cameras are designed for brief range only and are of a repaired brightness. This suggests they generally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing individuals and things to appear blown out" and without any detail. So much for attempting to identify the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, often are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear appropriately exposed and in full information. If a camera can not capture and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and during the night, it has restricted effectiveness.</p>
