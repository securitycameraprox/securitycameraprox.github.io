<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your kids and pets, but if you're concerned about security, you do not wish to risk missing out on a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with options for more by means of membership. Despite the fact that it doesn't have the largest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that included a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>

The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a free tier of cloud storage, so you have to invest at least $3 per month if you wish to conserve any videos.
