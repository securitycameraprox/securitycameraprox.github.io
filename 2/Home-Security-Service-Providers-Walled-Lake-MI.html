<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. Arlo Pro 2 also has an outstanding Night Vision feature. It is equipped with infrared lenses that allow the camera to tape-record videos even in total darkness. It has about 25 feet of visibility during the night. As such, even if someone get into your home in complete darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your smart device app. The only problem here is that the tape-recorded video footage will be black and white and a little dark so you might not have the ability to see information clearly.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

<p>so say you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I recommend to have actually cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.

Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a bigger area such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>
<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
