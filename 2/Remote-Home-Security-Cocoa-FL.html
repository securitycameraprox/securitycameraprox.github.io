<p>Outwardly there's no difference between the 1080p design of the Swann Smart Security Camera and its 720p predecessor: both utilize the same compact case, both utilize the very same install - and that latter feature is a shame.

<p>Easy alarm installation. One of the most aggravating parts of a home security system is the alarm installation. It can take hours for a team to install the alarm system, and you'll face different issues along the way. Nevertheless, the wireless system is easy to install.

<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection issues, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months. Scout is really easy to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't advise it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling appointments and taking time off from work. Contacting a professional costs more, however for those who prefer to let a professional handle the task and don't mind investing the additional money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
