<p>It's becoming more popular. But for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that provides two-way audio, go all out. Others and renters who are unsure the length of time they will be remaining in their current home should avoid entering long-lasting agreements. However, an exception can be made for home security systems that come with advantages like the ADT Mover's Savings Bundle, which enable you to take your equipment to a new home. This also depends upon the provider, but you can anticipate signing a contract with service providers who require professional installation of their systems. The typical length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some contracts could span up to 60 months or 5 years. If you wish to prevent having to sign an agreement, we would advise considering a DIY home security system instead.</p>
