Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
