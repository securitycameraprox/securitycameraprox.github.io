<p>All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup procedure. This generally includes discovering an area for your camera, producing an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>A wireless home security system utilizes a radio frequency to interact with the control panel and sensors. The control board then communicates with a monitoring center using a cellular signal.

The mount is magnetic, but it's strong, so you can quickly connect the camera and move it up, down, and everywhere in between.</p>
