As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
