<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
