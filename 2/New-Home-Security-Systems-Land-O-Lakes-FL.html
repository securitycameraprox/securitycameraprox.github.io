<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of complimentary storage, and use 2 AA batteries that can last up to 2 years. However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink doesn't provide you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and offer physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to call for cops response.</p>
