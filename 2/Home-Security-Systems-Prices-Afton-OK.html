Cellular systems use cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for numerous hours up until the electric service is restored. Landline systems use conventional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they usually have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
