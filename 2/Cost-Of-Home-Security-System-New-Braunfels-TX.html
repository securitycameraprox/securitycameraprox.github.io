Some popular cameras automatically override expired videos, which might not be most ideal if you require to keep a video.

IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
