Amongst IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical mistaken belief is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder straight which then links to the internet and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are totally cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the most convenient alternative to install and all of the recorded video footage is kept in the cloud.</p>
