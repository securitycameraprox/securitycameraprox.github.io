<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services using convenience, assurance and fulfillment to every customer and are committed to fulfilling our client's requirements with stability, honesty, interest and excellent service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering a number of decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>Limited functions - Much of the sophisticated features now offered with IP cameras (for example: megapixel resolution, digital zoom, and video analytics), aren't readily available in analog CCTV models. Besides the cost of the equipment, these wise home devices often charge a month-to-month charge. With security apps like Alfred, there is no complicated installation, IP settings, or contract. You just need to download Alfred to repurpose your old devices as a DIY WiFi Camera or infant monitor: pure and basic.</p>

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
