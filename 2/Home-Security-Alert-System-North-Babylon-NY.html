<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for more electrical wiring.
