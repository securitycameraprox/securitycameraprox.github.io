<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
