<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped housing that the camera sits in. Whilst these are reasonably discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from deterring lawbreakers. Since the dome housing makes it really difficult for individuals to see which instructions the camera is pointing, this is. This develops an air of unpredictability for prospective burglars or vandals approaching from all instructions. , if those scenarios sound like your life, Vivint and Link Interactive use some flexibility on monitoring contract length if you buy equipment up front..
