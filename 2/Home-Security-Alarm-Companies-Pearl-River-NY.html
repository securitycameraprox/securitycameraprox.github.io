<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
