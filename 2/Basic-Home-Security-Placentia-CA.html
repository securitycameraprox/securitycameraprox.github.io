<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, because it is rather connected directly to a network.

Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR.

In this case the alarm company owns the primary equipment such as control panel, keypad, motion sensor. Anything added extra you would own however if you do not restore their high priced strategy they'll eliminate their" equipment leaving you with no working alarm.
