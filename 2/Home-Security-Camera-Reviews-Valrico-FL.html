<p>Arlo claims that you must have the ability to get four to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
