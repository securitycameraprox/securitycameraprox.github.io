It has since been enhanced and now equals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home combination options. We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza.

We were able to track the cameras to their sources in five different instances. Comparable ALPR vulnerabilities were discovered in Boston by DigBoston and the Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism.</p>
<p>In the procedure of writing this guide, we interviewed peers, home security consultants, authorities departments, and insurance representatives. We also sent out security companies detailed questionnaires about their services and products.

It's likewise more tamper-proof than any of our other picks, however that added security produces a trickier installation process, and it costs nearly twice the rate of the Nest Cam Outdoor.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras are put in locations where they are believed to be most reliable, which typically consists of highly inhabited towns, city centers, car parks, or different other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008).
