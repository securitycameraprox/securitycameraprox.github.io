In long-term testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic.

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
