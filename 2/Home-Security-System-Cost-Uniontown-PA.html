<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Simply put, wireless security systems count on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensors needed to control your equipment including enabling, disabling and sending you instantaneous alerts. When a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, web, email, or text portal.
