<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. You can activate a video clip or a SmartThings automation if your camera spots motion or sound. This sequence of events also works in reverse. For example, if someone opens your front door when your SmartThings system is set to away," you can tape-record a clip and sound your Arlo siren (which happens to be the loudest of the 3 sirens).
