<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling appointments and taking some time off from work. Contacting a technician costs more, however for those who choose to let an expert manage the task and do not mind spending the extra money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
<p>The primary benefit of unmonitored security systems is cost. Even if you pay a professional to install your system, it will still be cheaper than a monitored system since most of the cost is in the monitoring service, instead of the equipment. A space's lighting conditions continuously altering, 24 hours a day. Low light, high brightness, and high-exposure environments all affect a camera's imaging quality.
