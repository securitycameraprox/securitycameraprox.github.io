Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automatic door lock and clever thermostat for the cost of equipment and $10 additional a month.

<p>Following behind the Ultra 4K is the brand name new Arlo Pro 3, which provides a similar package however with 2K video instead. When going shopping for a new security camera system, it's a great all-round system (particularly with several cameras) and should definitely be weighed up alongside the Ultra.
