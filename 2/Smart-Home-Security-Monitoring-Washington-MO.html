<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Really irritating. Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling sum, since apparently they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too expensive, and not fantastic.</p>

<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
