<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
