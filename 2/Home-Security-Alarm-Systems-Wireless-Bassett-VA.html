<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
