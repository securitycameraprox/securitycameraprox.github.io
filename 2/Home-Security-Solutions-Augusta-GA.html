<p>Primarily, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly two years of use, night and day images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when testing the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion found.

Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for recording a thief in the act, though. They're also useful for casual home monitoring. Put on countertops, racks, and tables, they enable you to keep an eye on what your family pets are doing, understand when the kids get home from school, or find who's been hitting the alcohol cabinet. Many even permit you to communicate with whoever is on-camera as the action is taking place, through an ingrained microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>Throughout our screening, this compact camera tape-recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a more detailed look.
