<p>The very first wireless function to consider is the security system and its parts, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring part was hard-wired back to a panel box.

<p>A base station is the center that links all your numerous sensors and gadgets together when it comes to home security systems. For home security cameras, a base station does the same thing-- however the devices in concern are all cameras. No matter how well they're installed or how elite they are, home security systems can cause false alarms. A false alarm happens when your alarm activates, and authorities react just to realize that there was no emergency situation.
