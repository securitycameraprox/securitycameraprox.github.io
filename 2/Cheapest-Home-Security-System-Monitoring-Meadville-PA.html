<p>Reuben Yonatan is the creator and CEO of GetVoIP, a New York-based digital telephone service. As a company owner in the tech market, my suggestion is geared towards small company owners who desire a thorough but economical security camera system," he says. Remote management usually includes establishing remote access to your video surveillance system and establishing strategies in case something takes place.

<p>Prior to choosing a security unit, know how the system works. Numerous security units use WiFi, cellular signals, or ethernet cable televisions to communicate.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.

The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
