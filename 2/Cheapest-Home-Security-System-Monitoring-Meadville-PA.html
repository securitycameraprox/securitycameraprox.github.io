<p>Prior to choosing a security unit, know how the system works. Numerous security units use WiFi, cellular signals, or ethernet cable televisions to communicate.

However, property owners with weak internet shouldn't opt for a WiFi-driven system because the signal will continue to render the security and drop system ineffective. If WiFi isn't an alternative, cellular connection is a good option. Ethernet cable televisions can link a system as well, however that implies cable televisions.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.

The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
