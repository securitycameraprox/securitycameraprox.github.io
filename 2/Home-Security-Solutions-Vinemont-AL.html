CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be reduced by modifying a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of an offender being apprehended, increasing the effort to devote the crime, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and reducing provocations that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
