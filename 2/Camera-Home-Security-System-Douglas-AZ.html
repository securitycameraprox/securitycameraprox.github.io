Not to mention the recent modifications in phone services, like (VOIP) Voice over web protocol which are not a reliable form of interaction for alarm or any information transmission, most of the time preventing alarm signals from going through to the main station.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
