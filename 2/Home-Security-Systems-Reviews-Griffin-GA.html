Just relocated to Los Angeles and I think I'm going to invest in a home security system for the very first time. I like the portability and low cost of Ring and SimpliSafe, but sounds like ADT is still the best option despite the higher cost. I think when compared to the cost of my house, it's a quite cheap rate to pay to keep it secured and safe.</p>

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, since obviously they car renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a headache, method too expensive, and not fantastic.</p>

<p>As for how to utilize one, they work the same as the majority of other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup.
