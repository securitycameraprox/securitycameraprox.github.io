<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
