Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
