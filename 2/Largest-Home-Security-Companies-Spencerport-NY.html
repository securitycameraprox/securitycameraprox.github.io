<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall.

<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stick out too much. Pretty simple to install. I likewise like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from the house. The second crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill in-built alarm, so it operates as a home alarm in addition to a security camera. That separates it from the items I have actually already written, and helps in part to explain its rate.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop notices (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off).
