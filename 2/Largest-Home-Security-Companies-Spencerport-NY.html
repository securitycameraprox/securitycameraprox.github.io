The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal construction.

<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stick out too much. Pretty simple to install. I likewise like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from the house. The second crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill in-built alarm, so it operates as a home alarm in addition to a security camera. That separates it from the items I have actually already written, and helps in part to explain its rate.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting.
