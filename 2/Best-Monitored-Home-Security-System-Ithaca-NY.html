<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is good. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling visits and taking time off from work.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
