<p>While every house owner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high expenses, complicated agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms.

<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
