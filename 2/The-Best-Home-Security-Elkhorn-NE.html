<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
