<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we loved it as an animal cam ). It has actually since been enhanced and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home integration choices. We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>

<p>No false alarm charges: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the authorities for a false alarm. Since the homeowner supervises of the system, cops are just gotten in touch with if there's a real emergency situation. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will call cops if a house owner can't validate a false alarm.

<p>Wireless security cameras being evaluated in a Customer Reports laboratory. If you do come across a home intrusion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB.

<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the gadget itself. This option is generally cost-free. A cloud storage choice saves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is usually a paid service and the variety of hours it will store will depend on how much cloud storage you want to spend for.</p>
